Rock Paper Scissors with Teachable Machine ✊ ✋ ✌!

## Challenges
Try implementing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock!

This is a slightly more complicated version of the classic game.
You will need to train a new model (teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) as well as updating your `checkWinner()` and `startGame()` functions with the additional cases.
